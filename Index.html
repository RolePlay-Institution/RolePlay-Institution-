        <p>Battle Roleplay, originally Roleplay Fighting. It's a hectic thing to do that sucks in every single cell that you need running at the start of the day. It involves knowledge, wit, strategy, and a mind working at full throttle. People even put their accounts and pride on the line! The thing is, what's so addictive?  I'd consider it as the thrill of imagination being put to words. Forging stories, creating this and that. The only downside is when you've known too much in comparison to the people around you, wanting to ascend yet your resources prove futile. Battle Roleplay isn't about the portrayal of characters, may they be original or canon, but the way someone paints what is in mind on a canvas where words intertwine, creating an interactive story. Many people forgot one of the key points of Text-based roleplay, it's enjoyment and improvement without involving deep-end pride and ego. People forgot that roleplay also embodies a way to tell an own-made story.</p>
